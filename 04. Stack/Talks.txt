Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of 
values and operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what procedures are to be performed but not 
how these operations will be implemented.
The stack is ADT. Abstract for users

In the case of Linked lists And Array, We focus on how data are stored.
But in the case of the stack, we focus on the features of the stack, not the storing idea.

If generic array creation were legal, then compiler-generated casts would correct the program at
 compile time but it can fail at runtime, which violates the core fundamental system of generic types.
