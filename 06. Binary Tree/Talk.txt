Tree Like Your Computer File System.

There is a root node And Every node has one  or more or Zero Child Node .

Tree has a beautiful Recursive Structure.

A tree consists of some or zero SubTrees.

A node is called as binary tree if only it has at max two child nodes. (0/1/2) . Not More than 2.

Otherwise it is called generic Tree.
 
 Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists 
 of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed).
  Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes.


  A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node
   has at most two children. 



   Terminologies =

 ancestor - Path From root to this/leaf node .. All nodes are called as Ancestor of this/leaf node.


Depth is a property of every node that means how much  far a node from root node

Balanced Tree 
| heightOf Right Sub Tree - Height of Left Sub Tree | <=1   for every Node
Then We call it Balanced tree
