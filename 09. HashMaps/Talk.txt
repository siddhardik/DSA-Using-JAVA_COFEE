for array key and value Should be integer

but HashMaps Key And Value Can be of Any Type
HashMaps implementation via linked list delete ,search, getValue  all are o(n) TC
via BST  o(logn) TC   TreeMap For Ordering 
Via HashTables implementation o(1) TC .     HashMaps'

Key Pass to Hash Function Its gives some integer.
Then Compress it %bucket Size   
then Store Key Value


Node of key value  Array of this types of node

but we cannot create a generic array 
So we should create a arraylist.
