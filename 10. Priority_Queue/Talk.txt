Priority matters in case of Priority Queue

Two types of priority Queue 
For max Priority Queueu max element will be come out first
For min priority queue min element will be come out first

Pririty Queue we can implement via heap easily.
We can also implement via array,lInked List ,BST,Tree
HAshmap also.

But Balanced BST is one of good option ,But Address Storing And balnacing maintain is complex.

We use Heap To implement Priority Queue 
Heap has two property 1} Complete  Binary Tree  And 2} Heap Order Property 
1} Complete  Binary Tree -> All Levels Should be completely  filled accept Last Level .
 -> Elements should be inserted into the last Level From left to right

-> You can't skip Any position
we represent CBT via Array and  and ith index represent parent node and 2*i +1 and 2*i +2 
 index are represent the child node if ith index's element.
 And get parent (i-1)/2      i represent child node's index
